# Database Design & Implementation in Django

This repository contains sample code accompanying the talk, originally given at the San Francisco Django Meetup Group on November 29, 2017.

## Abstract

Just because we're not writing lots of SQL queries, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be thinking about the underlying structure of the databases in our projects. We'll explore design considerations and demonstrate how model inheritance and meta keywords can be used to deliberately structure a Django database schema.
